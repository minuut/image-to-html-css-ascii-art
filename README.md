Notes: 

The output can be customized by reading the comments
in the code and making adjustments to the code as needed.

This tool is intended for personal use ONLY,
and is not designed with security in mind. 
It does not include any CSRF protection or saving functionality. 
For best results, it is recommended to use the raw HTML/CSS output 
generated by the script within your own projects for aesthetic purposes.
